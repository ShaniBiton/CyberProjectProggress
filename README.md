Proggress Update: Created a vulnerable system to act as the base of the honeypot (the bait).
                  The system contains a vulnerable database with 3 tables: accounts, orders and payments. The database contains sensetive information (dummy data), as bait for the attackers.
Next Step: Finish writing the functions "view profile" and "place order" on the server and the client code, add logs, and move on to plan the simulated attacks on the fake system.
